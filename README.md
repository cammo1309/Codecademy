**Mythical Creature Generator** (messages.js)

Description
  - The Mythical Creature Generator is a fun and creative JavaScript program that generates whimsical descriptions of fictional creatures. It combines various elements like animals, body parts, and extraordinary actions to create unique and imaginative creatures. This project is an excellent example of how to use basic JavaScript concepts such as classes, arrays, and functions.

Features
  - Generate Unique Creatures: Each execution creates a new mythical creature with random attributes.
  - Customizable Components: Easily expandable lists of animals, body parts, and actions for a wide range of possible combinations.
  - Grammar-Conscious Output: Correctly uses "a" or "an" based on whether the animal's name starts with a vowel.

How It Works
  - The generator randomly selects components from predefined arrays of animals, body parts, and actions. It then combines these elements into a string describing the mythical creature. For example, it might output something like "A Horse with the wings of an Eagle that can breathe fire."

Installation and Usage:
  This program is written in JavaScript and can be run in any JavaScript environment, such as a web browser or Node.js.

To use the program:
  Include the Script: Ensure that the JavaScript file is included in your HTML file or Node.js project.
  Call the Function: Use generateMythicalCreature() to generate a new creature.
  E.g `console.log(generateMythicalCreature());`
  
Customization

  To customize the generator:

  Modify the Arrays: You can add or remove elements from the animals, bodyParts, and actions arrays.
  Adjust the Logic: Feel free to tweak the logic in the generateMythicalCreature function for different styles of creature generation.
